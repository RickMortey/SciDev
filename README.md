# SciDev
SciDev is a course from ABBYY dedicated to Machine Learning, notably the use of Neural Networks is different spheres of appliance: s.t. Computer Vision, NLP and various tasks solved in these spheres.


This course has been completed by me in Spring 2023 and I would gladly share some of the results. During this course there were various homeworks. Some of them required to re-build Torch by yourself in simplified form (Minitorch), others required skills in solving NLP-based tasks(NLP-tokenization, NLP-Language Modelling), while a few on the other hand required skills in Computer Vision(e.g. Segmentation) or deep understanding of the scientific paper.


1. [Minitorch](https://github.com/a4-ai/sd23-fw-RickMortey)
2. [NLP-tokenization](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1cDQrvf0Xlf6iHVlodN5c_l5kiKhKj97p?usp=sharing)
3. [NLP-Language Modelling](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1i9jJxrn9obPGD67tjJprWlCYXhOZrrvW?usp=sharing)
4. [Segmentation](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1WROord7jme7yWdc-kURB-pIl9YPRHYC4?usp=sharing)
5. [Segmenter Paper Overview](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1qRhFIQhwLLpvUM_DJHi87iRvdC-PMX4dw7SD-QXcf2I/edit?usp=sharing) 


Also, during this course, multiple lectures have been watched, which allowed me to gain better understanding of how NN works and what are the best ways to use them. Here are some topics:
1. NN in global: forward pass and backprotagation
2. Various datasets and Architectures for Computer Vision tasks
3. Segmentation
4. GAN
5. NLP: Tokenization, Language Modelling
6. Attention (is all you need)
